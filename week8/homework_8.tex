\section{Pollard's Rho algorithm}
We have implemented Pollard's Rho algorithm as given.
We do a random walk until we hit a point where $t_i=r_i$ with $r_i = t_{2i}$ and where we can find inverses, then exploit this relation to find candidate solutions for a derived congruence relation.

We're getting correct results fast using this implementation.

\section{Index calculus}
We have implemented the index calculus algorithm as given.
We pick random exponents of g in the group to find the relation between the exponents of the group's inputs and outputs.
If we find relationships that are invertible we store them in a matrix until we have a determined system.
With a solution for these relationships we have the $log_g$ for each of the factor base elements.
If we now find a factorization of any group element multiple of the public key $h$ we can use these factors to express h in terms of $g$ using the $log_g$ values we obtained.

\begin{verbatim}
sage: load index_calculus.sage
Solving 2^a = 281 (mod 1019) using index calculus method on base [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
Solved system:
[  1   0   0   0   0   0   1]
[  0   1   0   0   0   0 958]
[  0   0   1   0   0   0  10]
[  0   0   0   1   0   0 363]
[  0   0   0   0   1   0 756]
[  0   0   0   0   0   1 289]
Found solution a=311 in 0.060 s
\end{verbatim}

We have a working result, but much worse performance.
This is likely due to the required linear equation solver, but also our implementation is far from optimal in terms of memory use for the matrix system.
In any case, because we do a purely random search of the group it's less predictable how long it will take to form a fully determined linear system.
